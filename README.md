TextFilter: SMS Spam Classification Model

TextFilter is a machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as either “Spam” or “Real” (ham). This project aims to improve the efficiency of message filtering, ensuring users experience a cleaner, spam-free inbox.

Project Overview

With the increasing number of spam messages, it is crucial to have an automated system to distinguish spam messages from real ones. TextFilter leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in spam detection.


Features:

- Preprocesses SMS messages using text-cleaning techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

- Implements various machine learning algorithms for classification, including:

- Logistic Regression

- Naive Bayes

- Random Forest

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to evaluate model performance.

- Exports a trained model for deployment.

Tech Stack:

- Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks:

- Scikit-learn

- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

- Pandas, NumPy

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- FastAPI (for API deployment)

- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
